The European binding instruments listed in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union are:&#xD;&#xA;•&#x9;regulations: these are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all EU countries;&#xD;&#xA;•&#x9;directives: these bind the EU countries as to the results to be achieved; they have to be transposed into the national legal framework and thus leave margin for manoeuvre as to the form and means of implementation;&#xD;&#xA;•&#x9;decisions: these are fully binding on those to whom they are addressed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on EUR-Lex&#xD;&#xA;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/community_legal_instruments.html &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The binding legal instruments that make up the secondary legislation of the EU are Regulations, Directives and Decisions.
