The Commission has started facilitating self-regulation in this area, encouraging providers to develop codes of conduct regarding the conditions under which users can port data between cloud service providers and back into their own IT environments,&#xD;&#xA;- Full consistency and synergies with the cybersecurity package, and clarification that any security requirements that already apply to businesses storing and processing data will continue to do so when they store or process data across borders in the EU or in the cloud.&#xD;&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/publication/regulation-free-flow-non-personal-data_en">
