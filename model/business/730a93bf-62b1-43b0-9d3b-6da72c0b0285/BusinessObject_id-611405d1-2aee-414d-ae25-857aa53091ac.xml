It can be generated by a wide range of parties, including public authorities, the semi-public sector, businesses and the public. In the case of public authorities, such as European Union organisations, making their data available for public reuse supports economic development, openness and transparency.&#xA;&#xA;Source: EU Open Data guide&#xA;http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/eu-open-data-pbOA0416036/downloads/OA-04-16-036-EN-C/OA0416036ENC_002.pdf?FileName=OA0416036ENC_002.pdf&amp;SKU=OA0416036ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=OA-04-16-036-EN-C &#xA;&#xA;INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;&#xA;IoP Dimension: Governance IoP &#xA;The Open Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because Open Data is a part of the basic components of the EIF's conceptual model for integrated public services. Opening of public sector datasets for sharing and reuse is encouraged by the Directive on the reuse of public sector information, which provides a common legal framework for reuse of public sector data as stated in the EIF recommendation nÂ° 2: &quot;Publish the data you own as open data unless certain restrictions apply.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;EXAMPLES:&#xA;EU implementation of the G8 Open Data Charter&#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-implementation-g8-open-data-charter">
