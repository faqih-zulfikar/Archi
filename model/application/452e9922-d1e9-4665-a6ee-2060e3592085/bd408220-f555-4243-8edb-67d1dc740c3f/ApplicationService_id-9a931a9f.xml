This information is collected by executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The information is sent according to the following process: each host periodically sends monitoring data to the front-end which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This model is highly scalable and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to the performance of the server running on and the database server.&#xD;&#xA;OpenNebula also brings resource quota management to allocate, track and limit resource utilization/consumption.&#xD;&#xA;https://opennebula.org/">
