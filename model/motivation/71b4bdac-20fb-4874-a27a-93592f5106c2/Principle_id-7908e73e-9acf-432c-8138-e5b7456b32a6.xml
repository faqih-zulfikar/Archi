    documentation="DESCRIPTION:&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Reusability refers to IT solutions (e.g. software components, Application Programming Interfaces, standards), European frameworks (reference architectures, architectural frameworks and ontologies), information and data.&#xD;&#xA;- Reference Architecture: Architecture is the structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time. A reference architecture is a generalized architecture of a solution, based on best-practices, domain neutral and, occasionally, with a focus on a particular aspect. The goal of a reference architecture is reusability; it reduces the amount of work, reduces errors and accelerates the development of solutions. A reference architecture should be based in a [reference] model and in a style. &#xD;&#xA;- Architectural framework: a tool for assisting in the production of organization-specific architectures. An architectural framework consists of a technical  reference model, a method for architecture development and a list of component standards, specifications, products and their interrelationships which can be used to build up architectures.&quot;">
