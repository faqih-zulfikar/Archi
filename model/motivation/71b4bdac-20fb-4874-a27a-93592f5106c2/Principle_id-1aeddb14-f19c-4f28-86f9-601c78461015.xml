Therefore, as far as possible, user needs and requirements should guide the design and development of public services, in accordance with the following expectations: i A multi-channel service delivery approach; ii A single point of contact should be made available to users; iii Users’ feedback should be systematically collected, assessed and used to design new public services and to further improve existing ones.">
