    documentation="DESCRIPTION:&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Evidence-based Public Policies are policies designed and periodically reviewed looking at experimental evidences and incontrovertible data. &#xD;&#xA;The primary goal is to improve the reliability of advice concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of policy settings and possible alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;There are three crucial enabling factors that underpin modern conceptions of evidence-based policy (EBP): high-quality information bases on relevant topic areas, cohorts of professionals with skills in data analysis and policy evaluation, and political incentives for utilising evidence-based analysis and advice in governmental decision-making processes.&quot;">
